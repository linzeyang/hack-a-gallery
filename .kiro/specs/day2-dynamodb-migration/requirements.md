# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for migrating the HackaGallery application's storage solution from browser localStorage to Amazon DynamoDB. The migration will enable persistent, scalable, cloud-based storage while maintaining the existing application functionality and leveraging the current storage adapter abstraction pattern.

## Glossary

- **HackaGallery**: The web application for showcasing hackathon projects
- **DynamoDB**: Amazon's fully managed NoSQL database service
- **Storage Adapter**: An abstraction layer implementing the IStorageAdapter interface that provides storage operations
- **LocalStorage Adapter**: The current Phase 1 implementation using browser localStorage
- **DynamoDB Adapter**: The new implementation that will use AWS DynamoDB for storage
- **Event Entity**: A hackathon event with details like name, dates, location, and prizes
- **Project Entity**: A hackathon project submission with details like name, description, team, and technologies
- **User Entity**: A platform user with role (hacker, organizer, or investor) and profile information
- **Partition Key (PK)**: The primary key attribute in DynamoDB that determines data distribution
- **Sort Key (SK)**: The secondary key attribute in DynamoDB that enables range queries and sorting
- **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: An alternate query pattern in DynamoDB with different partition and sort keys
- **AWS SDK v3**: The latest version of AWS SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Server Component**: Next.js component that renders on the server side
- **Client Component**: Next.js component that renders on the client side
