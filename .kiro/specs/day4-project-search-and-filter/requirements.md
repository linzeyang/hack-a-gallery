# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining gaps in HackaGallery's frontend implementation. After reviewing the existing codebase, the core DynamoDB integration patterns are largely implemented correctly with proper Server Components, API routes, and Client Components. However, there are specific security improvements needed and essential search functionality missing for project discovery.

## Glossary

- **Search_Interface**: User interface components for searching and filtering projects
- **AWS_Configuration**: Configuration module that manages AWS credentials and settings
- **API_Route**: Next.js API route handlers that process HTTP requests server-side (already implemented)
- **Storage_Service**: Service layer that abstracts storage operations (already implemented)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter hackathon projects, so that I can quickly find projects that match my interests or criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms, THE Search_Interface SHALL filter projects by title, description, and tags using client-side filtering
2. WHEN a user selects technology filters, THE Search_Interface SHALL display only projects using those technologies from the techStack array
3. WHEN a user applies event filters, THE Search_Interface SHALL show projects from specific hackathon events using eventId
4. WHEN search results are displayed, THE Search_Interface SHALL highlight matching terms in project titles and descriptions
5. WHERE no search results are found, THE Search_Interface SHALL display helpful messaging and suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment variable security, so that sensitive credentials are not exposed to the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring AWS credentials, THE AWS*Configuration SHALL remove NEXT_PUBLIC* prefixed options for DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME
2. WHEN configuring AWS endpoints, THE AWS*Configuration SHALL remove NEXT_PUBLIC* prefixed options for DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT
3. WHEN running in production, THE AWS*Configuration SHALL support HACKAGALLERY_AWS*\* prefixed variables for Vercel/Netlify compatibility
4. WHEN running locally, THE AWS*Configuration SHALL continue supporting standard AWS*\* environment variables
5. WHERE sensitive credentials are configured, THE AWS_Configuration SHALL NOT expose them to the browser environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive search functionality, so that I can find projects efficiently on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using search on mobile devices, THE Search_Interface SHALL provide touch-friendly filter controls with appropriate sizing
2. WHEN search results update, THE Search_Interface SHALL maintain smooth transitions and user context
3. WHEN applying multiple filters, THE Search_Interface SHALL show active filter indicators with clear removal options
4. WHEN search is performed, THE Search_Interface SHALL debounce input to avoid excessive re-filtering operations
5. WHERE search takes time, THE Search_Interface SHALL show loading indicators during filter operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want advanced search capabilities, so that I can discover projects using multiple criteria simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN combining search terms with filters, THE Search_Interface SHALL apply both text matching and filter criteria
2. WHEN clearing search criteria, THE Search_Interface SHALL provide a clear all option to reset filters
3. WHEN viewing search results, THE Search_Interface SHALL display result counts and active filter summaries
4. WHEN no filters are applied, THE Search_Interface SHALL show all available projects
5. WHERE search criteria are complex, THE Search_Interface SHALL maintain performance with efficient filtering algorithms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want missing API route methods, so that all CRUD operations are properly supported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading events, THE API_Route SHALL handle GET requests to /api/events endpoint
2. WHEN reading specific events, THE API_Route SHALL handle GET requests to /api/events/[id] endpoint
3. WHEN reading projects, THE API_Route SHALL handle GET requests to /api/projects endpoint
4. WHEN reading specific projects, THE API_Route SHALL handle GET requests to /api/projects/[id] endpoint
5. WHERE DELETE operations are needed, THE API_Route SHALL handle DELETE requests for both events and projects

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced project discovery, so that I can explore projects by various attributes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing projects, THE Search_Interface SHALL provide sorting options by date, title, or popularity
2. WHEN filtering by technology, THE Search_Interface SHALL show available technology options based on existing projects
3. WHEN filtering by events, THE Search_Interface SHALL show available event options with project counts
4. WHEN viewing filtered results, THE Search_Interface SHALL maintain filter state during navigation
5. WHERE projects have tags, THE Search_Interface SHALL provide tag-based filtering options
