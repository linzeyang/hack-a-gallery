## Introduction

This feature enables tracking and displaying prize awards for hackathon projects. Projects can be associated with specific prizes from their event, and users can filter projects based on whether they won prizes or not. This enhances the showcase value of winning projects and provides better discovery for users looking for award-winning solutions.
