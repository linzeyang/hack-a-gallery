# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating a basic agentic flow into the HackaGallery application using the strands-agents framework and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. The focus is on implementing the Project Intelligence Agent that analyzes GitHub repositories and generates AI-enhanced project descriptions, demonstrating the core value proposition of HackaGallery's AI-powered project enhancement capabilities.

This represents Day 3 of the development roadmap, building upon the existing Next.js frontend to add intelligent project analysis capabilities that will differentiate HackaGallery from traditional hackathon project galleries.

## Glossary

- **Project Intelligence Agent**: An AI agent built with strands-agents framework that analyzes GitHub repositories to extract technical details, generate summaries, and categorize projects
- **AgentCore Runtime**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime service that hosts and executes the deployed agent containers
- **strands-agents**: Python framework for building AI agents that will be used to implement the agent logic
- **Frontend Application**: The existing Next.js/React application that serves as the user interface
- **Backend Service**: Python FastAPI service that interfaces between the frontend and the AgentCore Runtime
- **GitHub Repository**: Source code repository that contains a hackathon project to be analyzed
- **Project Analysis**: The process of extracting metadata, tech stack, features, and generating descriptions from a repository
- **Agent Payload**: JSON data structure passed to the agent containing the repository URL and analysis parameters
- **Analysis Result**: Structured data returned by the agent containing project insights, tags, and generated content

1. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent analyzes a repository, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL identify the primary programming languages used with percentage distribution
2. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent analyzes repository files, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL extract framework and library dependencies from package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent files
3. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent processes the README file, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL extract key features and project objectives
4. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent completes tech stack analysis, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL generate a list of technology tags with confidence scores above 0.7
5. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent identifies AWS services in the code, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL tag the project with specific AWS service names

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hacker, I want to see the AI analysis results displayed in a user-friendly format on the frontend, so that I can review and confirm the generated project information before saving

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Backend Service receives the Analysis Result from the Project Intelligence Agent, THE Backend Service SHALL transform the result into a structured JSON response
2. WHEN the Frontend Application receives the analysis response, THE Frontend Application SHALL display the generated project summary in a preview card
3. WHEN the analysis includes technology tags, THE Frontend Application SHALL render the tags as interactive badges with color coding by category
4. WHEN the analysis is in progress, THE Frontend Application SHALL display a loading indicator with status messages
5. IF the analysis fails or times out after 30 seconds, THEN THE Frontend Application SHALL display an error message with retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Project Intelligence Agent to be built using the strands-agents framework and deployed to Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, so that the system meets the hackathon's technical requirements and demonstrates proper AWS AI agent implementation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL be implemented using the strands-agents Python framework
2. THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL use Amazon Bedrock Nova models as the underlying LLM
3. WHEN the agent is packaged for deployment, THE Backend Service SHALL create an ARM64-compatible Docker container image
4. WHEN the container is built, THE Backend Service SHALL push the image to Amazon ECR
5. WHEN the agent is deployed, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL be registered and running on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend service to provide a RESTful API endpoint for project analysis, so that the frontend can easily integrate with the agent functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend Service SHALL expose a POST endpoint at /api/projects/analyze accepting a JSON payload with repository_url field
2. WHEN the Backend Service receives a request at the analyze endpoint, THE Backend Service SHALL authenticate the request using API key validation
3. WHEN the agent invocation is successful, THE Backend Service SHALL return a 200 status code with the Analysis Result in JSON format
4. IF the repository URL is invalid or inaccessible, THEN THE Backend Service SHALL return a 400 status code with error details
5. IF the agent invocation fails or times out after 25 seconds, THEN THE Backend Service SHALL return a 503 status code with retry-after header

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a hacker, I want the system to handle GitHub API rate limits gracefully, so that my project analysis doesn't fail due to temporary API restrictions

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent encounters a GitHub API rate limit, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with maximum 3 attempts
2. WHEN the Project Intelligence Agent detects rate limit headers, THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL cache repository metadata for 5 minutes
3. IF all retry attempts are exhausted, THEN THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL return a partial analysis with available cached data
4. WHEN the Backend Service detects rate limit errors, THE Backend Service SHALL log the rate limit status for monitoring
5. THE Project Intelligence Agent SHALL use authenticated GitHub API requests to increase rate limit quota from 60 to 5000 requests per hour

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the agentic flow, so that I can debug issues and monitor system health effectively

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component encounters an error, THE component SHALL log the error with timestamp, component name, and stack trace to CloudWatch Logs
