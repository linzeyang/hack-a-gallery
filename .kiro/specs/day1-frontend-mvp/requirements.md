# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational frontend for HackaGallery's MVP, focusing on core user interactions for the hackathon submission deadline. The frontend will provide a modern, static landing page and essential CRUD operations for hackathon events and projects, with interfaces ready for future API and AI agent integration. The implementation prioritizes rapid development while maintaining code quality and AWS Amplify deployment readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modern Landing Page

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an attractive landing page that clearly explains HackaGallery's value proposition, so that I understand what the platform offers and am motivated to explore further.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a landing page with hero section, feature highlights, and call-to-action buttons
2. WHEN the landing page loads THEN the system SHALL present content using a modern visual design with consistent typography, spacing, and color scheme
3. WHEN a user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL display concise information about the product including tagline, problem statement, and key features
4. WHEN a user interacts with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and responsive feedback
5. WHEN the landing page is viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL adapt layout responsively for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

### Requirement 2: Hackathon Event Management (Organizer)

**User Story:** As an organizer, I want to create, edit, and manage hackathon events, so that I can showcase my events and accept project submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organizer accesses the event creation interface THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for event name, description, dates, location, prizes, and requirements
2. WHEN an organizer submits a valid event form THEN the system SHALL create a new event record and store it in local state
3. WHEN an organizer views their events list THEN the system SHALL display all events they have created with options to edit or hide each event
4. WHEN an organizer edits an event THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with existing data and update the record upon submission
5. WHEN an organizer chooses to hide an event THEN the system SHALL mark the event as hidden and exclude it from public listings
6. IF an organizer submits an event form with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission
7. WHEN an organizer successfully creates or updates an event THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation feedback

### Requirement 3: Hackathon Event Viewing (Public)

**User Story:** As any user, I want to view hackathon event details, so that I can learn about events and decide whether to participate or submit projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the events listing page THEN the system SHALL display all non-hidden events in a grid or list layout
2. WHEN a user clicks on an event card THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed event page showing full event information
3. WHEN a user views an event detail page THEN the system SHALL display event name, description, dates, location, prizes, requirements, and associated projects
4. WHEN no events exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message with guidance
5. WHEN an event has associated projects THEN the system SHALL display a list or grid of project cards within the event detail page

### Requirement 4: Project Submission Management (Hacker)

**User Story:** As a hacker, I want to submit, edit, and manage my projects for hackathon events, so that I can showcase my work and participate in events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hacker accesses the project submission interface for an event THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for project name, description, GitHub URL, demo URL, technologies used, and team members
2. WHEN a hacker submits a valid project form THEN the system SHALL create a new project record associated with the selected event and store it in local state
3. WHEN a hacker views their projects list THEN the system SHALL display all projects they have submitted with options to edit or hide each project
4. WHEN a hacker edits a project THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with existing data and update the record upon submission
5. WHEN a hacker chooses to hide a project THEN the system SHALL mark the project as hidden and exclude it from public listings
6. IF a hacker submits a project form with missing required fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission
7. WHEN a hacker successfully creates or updates a project THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation feedback
8. WHEN a hacker submits a project THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct hackathon event

### Requirement 5: Project Viewing (Public)

**User Story:** As any user, I want to view project details, so that I can explore hackathon submissions and discover innovative work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a project detail page THEN the system SHALL display project name, description, GitHub URL, demo URL, technologies used, team members, and associated event
2. WHEN a user views a project card in listings THEN the system SHALL display a preview with project name, brief description, and key technologies
3. WHEN a user clicks on a project card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed project page
4. WHEN a project has a GitHub URL THEN the system SHALL display it as a clickable link
5. WHEN a project has a demo URL THEN the system SHALL display it as a clickable link
6. WHEN no projects exist for an event THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message

### Requirement 6: AWS Amplify Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend configured for AWS Amplify deployment with CloudFront, so that the application can be deployed quickly and served globally with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL generate static assets compatible with AWS Amplify hosting
2. WHEN the build configuration is examined THEN the system SHALL include necessary configuration files for Amplify deployment
3. WHEN the application is deployed to Amplify THEN the system SHALL serve content through Amazon CloudFront CDN
4. WHEN environment-specific configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables for different deployment stages
5. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the system SHALL optimize assets for performance (minification, code splitting, image optimization)

### Requirement 7: API and Service Integration Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean abstraction layer for future API and agent integration, so that backend services can be connected without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use a service layer abstraction that can be swapped from local state to API calls
2. WHEN the codebase is examined THEN the system SHALL have a clear separation between UI components and data access logic
3. WHEN API integration is needed in the future THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to component code
4. WHEN service methods are called THEN the system SHALL use consistent interfaces (async/await patterns, error handling)
5. WHEN mock data is used THEN the system SHALL structure it identically to expected API responses
6. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL provide configuration points for API endpoints and service URLs
